# Neighborhood Map

## Overview
I was tasked to develop a single page application featuring a map of my neighborhood or a neighborhood I would like to visit. The map should include highlighted locations, third-party data about those locations and various ways to browse the content.

The app allows users to view coffee shops around Ubud, Bali.

This is the final project for the Udacity Front-End Web Development Nanodegree.

## Instructions
1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Install the project dependencies by running `npm install` in terminal
3. Start the development server by running `npm start` in terminal
4. Open your browser to `localhost:3000`

## Using the Service Worker
`create-react-app` includes a built-in service worker that is available in production. To use it in production:

1. Run `npm build` in terminal. This will create a production ready version of the app that will be fully functional without network access.
